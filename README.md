##The Idea

Our system aims to solve the problem of having a poor working environment and habits. Since most of our lives are spent at work, our work environment and the habits that we develop have a huge impact on our health and well-being. Our idea of the smart office consists of two parts, the first being smart blinds, to regulate the light level in the environment, and the second being a smart seat, which serves to discourage a sedentary lifestyle by reminding the user to get up every so often through vibrations in the seat cushion as well as alerts on an Android app running on the user's phone or tablet.
