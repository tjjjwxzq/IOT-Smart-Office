THE INVISIBLE HAND

2. Discouraging a sedentary lifestyle
An android app running on the user's phone maintains a bluetooth connection to an arduino wired up to a force sensitive resistor and a vibration motor. The app allows the user to set up periodic alerts which will remind him/her to get out of his/her seat after a prolonged duration of sitting. The app first tries to pair with the bluetooth module on the arduino, and once paired, offers the user the option to turn on alerts (which sends a signal to the arduino to start checking the force sensor data) as well as change user settings. When the user chooses to turn on alerts, he/she will be prompted to specify a location, which will be used to categorize the data collected by the app.

2.1 Alert Tiers
Once alerts are turned on, the arduino will send a signal to the app if the force sensor registers that the user has been sitting down for longer than a certain threshold duration (which can be set by the user). It will also trigger the vibration motor for a short period. The user may choose to heed or dismiss the alert (which will be determined by how long the force sensor has registered the user to be off the seat). Alerts are tiered, so that when alerts are first turned on, the first alert sent will be of the lowest tier, with a short and low-intensity vibration of the motor and a short alarm triggered from the app. If the user dismisses this alert, then next alert will be of the next tier, triggering and longer and higher-intensity vibration and longer alarm from the app. 

For the protoype, four tiers will be coded into the app, each with increasing duration and intensity. For the lulz, the final tier will culminate in the app playing an exercise video from Zuiikin Girls, which should be more than enough to evict the user from his/her seat.

2.2 User Settings 
The user settings include basic profile and login information as well as alert settings. The user may set the time interval between each alert, as well as the alarm sound, alert message, vibration strength, and whether or not the alert should play exercise videos for each tier of alerts. Additionally, the user may choose to enable smart interval timing, which will allow the system to automatically adjust the time interval between alerts to more effectively discourage prolonged sitting. For example, the system may decrease the time interval if it detects that the user is consistently triggering the fourth tier alarm for too many sessions.

2.3 Data Collection
Data collection of the user's sitting habits will enable to app to implement smart interval timing as well as display a chart of the data to allow the user to assess his/her own habits.

The data collected will be the average sitting duration per day, and will be stored in a Firebase database. The data will also be categorized by location which the user enters when starting a session. This will allow the user to assess his/her habits across time as well as across different environments, and allow him/her to make informed changes to his/her lifestyle.
